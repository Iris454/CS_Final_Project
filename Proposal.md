# Escape Room Project Proposal

### Description:
For the Final Project, we will be creating an Escape Room Game. The game is set in an isolated hotel in the 1950s, located right next to a cliff. The player will solve math questions and puzzles to collect items/search for hidden items in the rooms that they will need to escape the hotel.
We will have rooms such as the lobby, pool, elevator, gym, and hotel rooms etc. 
There will be hints showing up if the player is trapped in a room. 

## Need to have list:
- a bag (list) for the player to collect items
- a progress level bar
- other characters to interact with the player and provide useful information
- room descriptions
- move function
- a function for the player to go over the collected items and choose an item to use
- puzzles and math questions showing up when finding certain items
- story background description at the start of the game

## Nice to have list:
- money to spend in restaurants to buy food
- a notepad to record information

## Target User
 16+ (preferably people with Calculus knowledge)

## Example Catch Phrases
- "xxx (player's name), do you want to enter the pool or the restaurant?"
- "No, the front door is locked. You need a key."
