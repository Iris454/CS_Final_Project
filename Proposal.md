# Escape Room Project Proposal
### Description:

For the Final Project, we will be creating an Escape Room Game. The game is set in a hotel in the 1950s, right next to a cliff. The player will solve math questions and puzzles to collect items that they will need to escape the hotel.
We will have rooms such as the lobby, pool, elevator, gym, hotel rooms etc. 
There will be hints showing up if the player stucks in a room. 

## Need to have list:
- a bag (list) for the player to collect items
- a progress level bar
- other characters to interact with the player and provide useful information
- room descriptions
- move function

## Nice to have list:
- money to spend in restaurants to buy food
- a notepad to record information

## Target User
 16+ (preferably people with Calculus knowledge)

## Example Catch Phrases
- "xxx (player's name), do you want to enter the pool or the restaurant?"
- "No, the front door is locked. You need a key."
